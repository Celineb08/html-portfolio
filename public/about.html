<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Celine.  I have recentley taken an interest in learning web development and hope the continue moving foraward in the tech world and learn more about it everyday!  The goal is to become a full stack web developer, and then eventually learn more programming.
I really believe a career in information technology would elevate my life and open so many doors. </p>

<p>Aside from learning how to code, I enjoy cooking and experimenting with new recipies, crafting anything from stained glass to macrame, to knitting, working out, hiking, and doing anything with my doggies.
I love nature and the outdoors.
I was born in Virginia, and I have lived in 5 different states.
</p>

<p>In the future,  I hope to live a happy life with a great partner by my side as we raise our little bean.
I want to travel often, have fun, and make good memories.  I know learning web development can sometimes be a headache but I think it will all pay off and practice makes perfect!
